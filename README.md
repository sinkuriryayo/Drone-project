# DIY Drone Project

## Overview
This project involves designing and building a custom drone from scratch. It demonstrates my expertise in drone technology, flight controllers, and motor control.

## Features
- Stable flight using a PID controller.
- Obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.
- Remote control via a mobile app.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Hardware**: Flight controller (Arduino/STM32), motors, propellers, sensors.
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, Python (for remote control).
- **Libraries**: MultiWii (for flight control).

## How It Works
The drone uses a flight controller to stabilize itself and respond to user inputs. Ultrasonic sensors help it detect and avoid obstacles.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Unstable flight.
- **Solution**: Tuned PID controller parameters for better stability.
